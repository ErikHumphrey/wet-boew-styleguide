    <p>Information can be published online in many different formats . Each  format has a specific purpose:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></strong> format is meant for structuring and laying  out information on the web</li>
      <li><strong>Word </strong>documents are great for templates or other  types of information that require easy edits</li>
      <li><strong><abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr>s </strong>are best used for official or legal  publications
        <ul>
          <li>They preserve the integrity of the content and layout of the  document</li>
          <li>Generally they are not meant for edit</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong><abbr title="Powerpoint file">PPT</abbr>s</strong> are used for delivering presentations and  if published online,
        <ul>
          <li>They are only ideal when you anticipate someone else might  want to present the same presentation or use it as a template</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Excel</strong> is meant for sharing tabular data</li>
    </ul>

<p>While different formats can be used online based on a specific need,  <strong><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the best format for online content</strong>. </p>
    <p>When documents are published online in formats other than <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, such as  Word, <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr>, <abbr title="Powerpoint file">PPT</abbr>, or Excel, it creates a number of issues because these formats  are not primarily meant for the web:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inaccessible information because documents are  not created with web principles in mind</li>
      <li>Incomplete information&nbsp; because document format and layout (such as a  <abbr title="Powerpoint file">PPT</abbr> slide or an infographic in a <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr> format) may restrict the amount and type  of information communicated</li>
      <li>Unresponsive documents which do not adjust to  meet users&rsquo; needs in different online contexts (such as mobile)</li>
      <li>Duplicated information that takes up more server  space, which results when multiple formats are available for the same  information </li>
      <li>Conflicting information, which results when  multiple formats are available for the same information, but only one format  gets updated while the others are forgotten</li>
      <li>Documents that are difficult to update because  of format restrictions (for example a <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr> of an infographic would take lots of  effort, time and money to update if a problem or usability issue is found  because the document was designed with specific presentation and visuals in  mind in a finite amount of document space, making addition of any extra  information impossible)</li>
      <li>Unsustainable practices are reinforced as  alternative formats are created for print, and therefore encourage printing of  documents</li>
      <li>Inflexible information which cannot be reused as  it is locked down in specific document formats and cannot be extracted by a  content management system (<abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr>)</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-xl">
      <p>Structuring content for reuse means we can create, publish  and use content more efficiently. We can assemble and reassemble it for  different products, audiences, devices or contexts of use. Information embedded  in documents makes this process difficult, if not impossible. [&hellip;] Content  volume also affects findability. The &ldquo;we could put that online&rdquo; mentality runs  unchecked when publishing is as easy as &lsquo;save as <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr>&rsquo; and upload.

<p>Once you define users' tasks, determine the information they need to  complete those tasks: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Keep information specific to  the tasks </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Present it logically or  sequentially in a location where users expect to find it</strong></li>
  <li>Ensure information is timely  and relevant, not redundant or trivial</li>

</ul>


    <p>Since you can&rsquo;t identify all user needs, and because these needs change,  content creators should provide users with a <strong>feedback mechanism</strong>. Content  owners should be open to users' suggestions for changes and modifications. </p>

    <p>There  are different approaches to writing for print and writing for web. This applies  to headings as well.</p>
    <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-xl">
      <p>(In) an article in <em>The New York Times </em>about tall people's travails on the road: "Coping With the Tall Traveler's Curse.",...(the) <strong>headline</strong> itself is actually an example of the differences between print and online content style: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In print, a phrase like "tall traveler's curse" is a bit enticing and   might draw readers in. Because the article featured a photo of a tall   guy crunched in the back of a taxi, the article's content was clear to   anybody glancing at that page in the newspaper</li>
        <li>In contrast, putting the same headline online would fail several  guidelines for writing for the Web :
          <ul>
            <li>The first 3 words have <strong>no information-carrying content</strong>. On the Web, you must start with words like "tall traveler" because users often  scan down the left part of a list of items. They never see the last words in a link unless the first few words attract their attention</li>
            <li>The headline <strong>lacks keywords </strong>&mdash; such as "airline seat" and "hotel bed" &mdash; that are important for   search engine optimization (<abbr title="search engine optimization">SEO</abbr>). No one will search "curse" when trying   to find out which hotel chains offer extra-long beds or which airline   seats are the least unpleasant for long-legged travelers</li>
            <li>The words "tall traveler's curse" are <strong>insufficiently specific </strong>to tell users what the story is about. Because headlines are often   presented as plain links removed from the article itself, the photo of   the poor guy in the cab won't be there to explain the story's content.   Online, the headline alone must provide enough  information scent to let users predict what they'll get if they follow the link</li>

    <div id="intranet-ia-info">
      <p>On the intranet, headings and menu labels have to be distinct and meaningful to users, focusing on topics and tasks rather than organizational structure.</p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-xl">
        <p>Many intranets suffer from confusing menu labels. Such labels make it difficult for users to find what they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
        <p>The most common reasons for confusion are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Terms are too broad and end up acting as catch-all (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr>, For Employees)</li>
          <li> Sections such as How do I&hellip; or Tools grow too big</li>
          <li> Different section names on the site lack distinction (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr>, Human Resources and Administration &amp; Management may appear in the same menu)</li>
          <li> Language is polluted with jargon or branded terms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unclear naming is one of the biggest and most important projects to tackle when it comes to the intranet <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr>. Each navigation category must be descriptive, specific, and mutually exclusive so that users can pick where to navigate without hesitation.</p>
        <p>...intranets are initially structured to mimic the organizational configuration of the company, because this type of <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr> makes maintenance of the intranet easy: each department or area gets a section of the intranet. However, the down side is that every time there&rsquo;s a re-org in the institution, the navigation has to change too. We have also found, in our user testing of intranets, that task-based navigation tends to facilitate learning.</p>
        <p>A common pitfall with task-based <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr>'s is difficult-to-scan category names. Organizations think that category names need to start with verbs or follow an &ldquo;I need to...&rdquo; pattern in order to be task based. This isn&rsquo;t necessary. Sometimes trying to fit link or menu labels to a specified format makes them long and more difficult to scan, because the most meaningful words don't appear until the end of the label. Task-based <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr> doesn't require any particular grammatical structure for labels; it just means grouping information according to how employees use it, rather than by who creates and maintains it.</p>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Hyperlinks  guide users</strong> to the information they are looking for. Use hyperlinks to avoid  repeating information that is already clearly expressed on another web page or  to reference related information, such as definitions, supporting information,  and background information.</p>
    <p><strong>Use the title of the  target page as the text in the hyperlink</strong>. It is very confusing to  users if the link text and page name don't match. In  situations when you need to modify the link text, try to <strong>match the text as closely as possible</strong> to the page name.</p>
    <p>To meet accessibility requirements,make the <strong>target  of each link clear, and without any additional context beyond the link text</strong>.&nbsp; Screen reader users can read pages by  generating a list of all the links on the page, and tab from link to link  without any surrounding context. If the wording of the link does not clearly  summarize the content of the target, it can confuse screen reader users. Refer to <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/writing/strctr-en.html#heading">Optimize headings and menu labels</a>. </p>
    <p>If  you refer to another web page more than once, <strong>add a hyperlink only to the first reference</strong>. Avoid putting  too many hyperlinks in a single paragraph. It can be confusing if they  are too close together. Users are not always able to tell where one hyperlink  ends and the next one begins.</p>
    <p>Users  are attracted to hyperlinks and follow them if they see them. Since you don&rsquo;t  want users to ignore the content of the page they are on<strong>, only add a hyperlink to references that can help users complete their  task or that provide valuable information about the task.</strong> Do not add a  hyperlink to unnecessary or unrelated information. Too many hyperlinks are  distracting and it becomes difficult for users to distinguish between important  and unimportant information. Ensure that the hyperlinks direct users to the  right page.

      </ul>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Lists  are easier to scan than paragraphs. </strong>They help highlight or emphasize single idea statements or list items. When you have a series of short, simple points, use lists instead of  paragraphs. Avoid more than one idea per list item. <strong>Sub-lists </strong>are sometimes confusing and difficult to scan. Avoid them  as much as you can. Try to <strong>limit  lists to two levels</strong>. </p>
    <p>Each list requires one of the following: a<strong> descriptive and unique heading</strong>, a <strong>lead-in sentence </strong>or an<strong>  introductory paragraph</strong> to provide some context. Avoid overusing  lists; using too many lists destroys their effectiveness. <strong>Don't make a lead-in sentence like a header - use a proper header</strong>.</p>
    <p>Arrange  list items in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>logical or sequential order, or by</li>
      <li>priority, importance, or popularity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If  you list a series of items <strong>where the  order is important, use numbers rather than bullets</strong>. List items with <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/writing/stl-en.html#parallel">parallel structure</a> to  help users quickly scan lists.</p>
    <p>Generally, <strong>do not alphabetize lists</strong>. The user  may not be sure which letter their desired information  falls under.  Alphabetize lists when the information has a stable naming convention, like  the names of people or places.</p>
     <p class="mrgn-tp-lg"><span class="fa  fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>To make lists consistent, </strong>to align with <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/csc-grc-eng.asp" rel="external">Canada.ca style guide <span class="wb-inv"> (external link)</span></a> (the current authoritative source), and to make it easier for readers to  scan lists at different screen sizes and resolutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduce each list with a statement that ends in a colon (:)</li>

        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> Images       must support the information</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> Users       regularly ignore images</li>

        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> Text       must accompany and fully describe the images &minus; for non-visual users</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Only  add an image if it supports the information that users are looking for. Images need  to help users with navigation or comprehension. Otherwise, the image gets in  the way when users search for relevant information, or they simply ignore it. </p>
    <p> An  image should be professional-looking and &nbsp;modern. Ensure it is clear and non-pixilated.  In addition, <strong>beware that most images are  protected by copyright</strong>. Use only images from approved sources, and  obtain the necessary permission  to use them. </p>
    <p> To meet accessibility  requirements, <strong>always provide text alternatives (alt text) for all non-text content,  such as images,</strong> so that it can change into other forms people that need.  Some examples include large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language. When  providing alt text, follow these principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alt text</strong> should  describe the image and except for rare occasions, must not exceed <strong>125 characters (including spaces)</strong></li>
      <li>For complex  images,&nbsp;or images that require more than 125 characters, do the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Provide a simple text statement as the <strong>alt</strong> value</li>
            <li>Provide a more detailed text description, coded immediately before or       after the image</li>
          </ul>
       </li>
       </ul> <p>This ensures that all users have access to a plain       description of the image, supports different learning styles and      meets accessibility requirements. The content must <strong>fully</strong> describe the image for the non-visual users that use text-to-speech software. <strong>Non-visual  users require the same experience as visual users,</strong> and need to understand  all information without any associated images.</p>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Tables  are an effective way to present information. <strong>Use them only to display financial, statistical, comparative, or  numerical information</strong> &ndash; not to serve stylistic purposes. If it makes  sense to present the data using a spreadsheet, then it is appropriate to  present the same data in a table. For alternatives to tables, speak to your web team.</p>
    <p>Like  text, ensure tables are <strong>clear and concise</strong>, with as few data elements as  possible in each cell. If you need to include more than a few words in any  cell, consider using another format. Also, if your table has cells that are more than 50% empty, it is harder to scan between table headers and associated content &minus; consider using another format.</p>
    <p>If  there is not enough <strong>white space</strong> in  each cell, data becomes difficult to read. Ensure that each row and column has  a clear and concise heading. This allows screen readers to unambiguously convey  the content of the tables. </p>

    </div>
    <p>Colour should enhance usability, not compete  for attention; <strong>less colour is more</strong>. Limited colour palette represents a coordinated and connected approach to content across the entire web presence and enhances users' <strong>trust</strong> in information.</p>
    <p> Colour is effective when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Maximum of 3 main colours and 3 accent colours are used across a single  website</li>
      <li> Cultural meaning of colour is considered</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It <strong>groups  similar content or indicates differences</strong>. When using colour, consider how it  affects users with visual limitations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Colour cannot be the only  element used to convey information</strong> &ndash; colour blind people can have trouble &nbsp;understanding it (use in combination with  text, texture)</li>
      <li> Certain complementary colour combinations can create <strong>visual vibrations</strong> which make it really  hard to read (for example, red on blue, yellow on blue, white on yellow)&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Text and background  need to have <strong>high contrast</strong> &ndash; the  tool <a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php" rel="external">Luminosity Colour Contrast Ratio Analyser</a> can analyze the background and foreground  colours to determine if there is sufficient contrast. Users read black text on  white background up to 32% faster than light text on a dark background.</p>

      <p>Color coding permits users to rapidly scan and quickly perceive patterns  and relationships among items. Items that share the same color will be  considered as being related to each other, while items with prominent color  differences will seem to be different. </p>

    <p>On the web, 90% of information is in the form of written  language, and is presented with fonts. Fonts affect the <strong>speed and comfort</strong> with which users understand and read content. Refer  also to <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/writing/strctr-en.html#colour">Colour</a>.</p>
    <p>When choosing fonts, follow these principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Do not use more than 3 fonts and 3  colours </strong>across a single website.
        <ul>
          <li> It makes the website look unstructured and  unprofessional</li>
          <li>Most websites have a limited number of pre-determined fonts allowed for web use. Speak to your web team if you need more information</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Use standard web fonts </strong>which  users can quickly recognize and read</li>
      <li><strong>Use sans serif fonts </strong>(like Ariel) for content</li>
      <li><strong>Limit  the use of serif fonts</strong> which have "arms" and "feet" (like Times  New Roman) to headings only</li>
      <li><strong>Do not use Comic Sans or</strong> <strong> Impact fonts</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Use coloured fonts carefully</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>Do not use blue text for content; users can mistake it for links</li>
          <li>Use black text on white background  for best readability</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Do not use italics</strong> as they can slow down the reading speed
        <ul>
