  <p>Content  architecture is how tasks and information about those tasks are categorized and organized &minus; whether it's one web page, or spread over dozens of pages. Good content architecture suits your users'  needs and expectations so they can quickly find  what they need.</p>

        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> Scrolls are better than pages when reading single articles or topics</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Historically,  content was broken down into smaller chunks and spread over numerous pages, as  users did not scroll down. This is no longer true today. Although a user spends  most of their time viewing information above the fold (the part of a webpage that is visible without scrolling), a strong <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/writing/stl-en.html#scent">scent of information</a> prompts  them to explore the rest of the page. Users need a reason to scroll. <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/writing/rchtctr-en.html#structure">Organize your page structure</a> in a way that highlights the most important information at the top, so that a user has an interest in reading information below the fold.</p>
    <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-xl">
      <p>Web users spend 80% of their time looking at  information above the page fold. Although users do scroll, they  allocate only 20% of their attention below the fold. </p>
      <p>During the Web's first years, users often didn't scroll Web pages at  all...Today, users will scroll. However, you shouldn't ignore the fold  and create endless pages for two reasons: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Long pages continue to be problematic because of users' limited attention span</li>
        <li>The real estate above the fold is more valuable than the stuff below the fold for attracting and keeping users' attention</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, yes, you can put information below the fold rather than limit  yourself to bite-sized pages. <strong>In fact, if you have a long article, it's  better to present it as one scrolling canvas than to split it across  multiple page views. Scrolling beats paging because it's easier for  users to simply keep going down the page than it is to decide whether  or not to click through for a next page of a fragmented article.</strong> But  no, the fact that users scroll doesn't free you from prioritizing and  making sure that anything truly important remains above the fold.  Information foraging theory states that people decide whether to  continue along a path (including scrolling path down a page) based on  the current content's information scent. In other words, users will  scroll below the fold only if the information above it makes them  believe the reset of the page will be valuable. </p>

      <p>Although people weren't used to scrolling in the mid-nineties,  nowadays it's absolutely natural to use the browser's scrollbar. For a  continuous and lengthy content, like an article or a tutorial,  scrolling provides even better usability than slicing up the text to  several pages. </p>

      <p> What do users hate more: long pages full of information that require lengthy scrolling or having to drill down through multiple&mdash;albeit shorter&mdash;pages to find what they need? Ask them, and they&rsquo;ll often say, "We hate scrolling." But usability tests say otherwise. Folks don&rsquo;t seem to mind scrolling, as long as they believe that it will eventually pay off. </p>
      <p> In the trade-off between hiding content below the fold or spreading it across several pages, users have greater success when the content is on a single page. However, if you&rsquo;re going to go with longer pages, you&rsquo;d better make sure that your users can easily find the information they need. </p>

    <p><strong>Organize  your content by topic, task, or audience to best suit your user's needs.</strong> Each  user is there to complete a task; ensure your categories always lead to a task.  Organize your content so the most popular tasks are the easiest to find. Keep  the structure <strong>simple, logical, and consistent</strong> so users quickly become familiar  with it. Users can then  navigate through your content quicker and easier. For example,  use numbered steps if the content is procedural, and the user needs to follow  each step from start to finish. </p>
    <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-xl"> Remember that web users are task-oriented: they come to a website with a goal in mind. Information organized by topic or by frequent tasks is often easier to navigate because it immediately addresses what people seek. [&hellip;] Audience-based navigation demands additional cognitive effort from users, as they must determine which category to choose, what information to expect in each category, and whether there is other useful information in different audience groups. It forces users to identify themselves instead of presenting topics upfront. But by ensuring that categories are mutually exclusive, and that there is sufficiently unique content to justify a new section, designers can reduce the risks of this type of navigation.

    <p>Providing information &ldquo;at the point of need&rdquo; means placing the right amount of information &ndash; <strong>no more and no less</strong> &minus; in the context where a user would expect to find it. To provide information at the point of need, you need to know <strong>what information users would expect to find together in one place </strong>to help them complete a task and what information they would expect to find in a different context, without loss of meaning.

    <p>According to usability expert Jakob Nielsen, progressive  disclosure improves three of five usability components: learnability, efficiency of  use, and error rate. <strong>Progressive  disclosure reduces complexity of user interaction as well as their cognitive  load; it helps with decision making and increases efficiency and ease of use of  the interface</strong>. To apply this principle effectively:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on the information the user needs to complete a specific task</li>
      <li>Provide the right level of detail at the right time; consider if you should  move from abstract to specific, from basic to expert</li>
      <li>Limit the number of choices to reduce potential confusion</li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t overwhelm users with too much information at once; they will waste  time trying to figure out what information is relevant or what links to click  on, amidst the many options</li>
      <li>Make additional information available within reach</li>

      <p>The term cognitive load was originally coined by psychologists to describe the mental effort required to learn new information. Though web browsing is a much more casual activity than formal education, cognitive load is still important: users must 'learn' how to use a site's navigation, layout, and transactional forms. And even when the site is fairly familiar, users must still carry around the information that is relevant to their goal. For instance, when planning a vacation, the users&rsquo; cognitive load includes interface-related knowledge and specific vacation-related constraints that they may have (such as price and timeframe).</p>
      <p>When a computer can't handle our processing demands, we can simply upgrade to a newer, more powerful machine. But to date there's no way to increase the actual processing power of our brains. Instead, designers must understand and accommodate these limits.</p>

    <p>Site  visitors do not access the same web pages during every visit, nor do they  access them in the same order during every visit. For this reason, <strong>write each web  page so it can stand on its own</strong>. Don't make assumptions as to what users have  previously read or will subsequently read. Web usage is never linear.</p>
    <p>In  some instances, you need to repeat phrases or sentences across many web pages  so that the information on each page is complete. If you repeat a lot of  supporting content, you may want to create a new page for that information and  link to it from the other pages or you may have to <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/writing/dvlpmnt-en.html#reuse">reuse and recycle content in another way</a>.</p>
    <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-xl">
      <p>When we look at a webpage, we tend to see it not as a whole, but rather   as compartmentalized chunks of information. We tend to read in blocks,   going directly to items that seem to match what we're actively looking   for.</p>
      <p>An eye-tracking study conducted by Nielsen revealed an eye-movement   pattern that could further support this idea that web users do indeed   read in chunks: We swipe our eyes from left to right, then continue on   down the page in an F-shaped pattern, skipping a lot of text in between.</p>
      <p>We can do several things to accommodate these reading patterns. One   strategy is to break up long articles into sections so that users can   easily skim down the page. This applies to block reading (because blocks   of text are denoted by headings) as well as the F-shaped pattern,   because we're attracted to the headings as we move down the page.</p>

      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> Do not create extra  pages of content (such as <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr>'s) to compensate for lack of order and structure  of old content</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> Edit and re-organize  existing content to help users find the right information quickly</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> Provide answers to users questions in  context with related information</li>

    </div>
    <p><abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr>  pages are often created as a band-aid solution to an otherwise messy content  environment. Contrary to improving discovery of important information, <strong><abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr>'s are generally not user friendly</strong>.  They tend to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Separate information from the context in which it needs to  be understood </li>
      <li> Duplicate information </li>
      <li> Make users look for information in multiple places</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since  most <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr>'s are long and contain varied information, users find them frustrating  They have to go through a long list of questions without knowing if they can find  the answer they need. Also, multiple pages  equal more waiting time, as each page has to load.</p>
    <p>In  general, <strong>users&rsquo;  questions are best answered in context with other information on the same  topic</strong>. Instead of having multiple pages on a single topic, find where the  content already exists.  Restructure the page to include the necessary  information. <strong>Do not create an extra <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr> page.</strong></p>
    <p>How  you organize the page depends on the  page content and the  users. For  example, procedures and processes are best organized by tasks. <strong>In most other  situations, topical organization can replace questions and answers.</strong> If you feel that your  information is best organized with questions and answers, ensure the page  breaks up questions into logical topic sub-sections, and has a meaningful and  descriptive title.</p>
