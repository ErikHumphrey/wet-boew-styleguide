  <p>Content development  is the process of identifying what information meets your users needs to complete their tasks, as well as meets your organizational goals. The process involves defining your users and identifying their tasks. </p>

    <p>To publish information on the web you need to to understand how online  content is different from print. Consider what information is already online, and  who your information is for (audience). Determine  your users' needs; determine your business objectives.</p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="print"><span id="print-heading">What is the difference between print and web?</span></h3>
  <div id="print-info">
    <div class="well">
      <p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> Authors       who write content specifically for the web create a positive user       experience, which helps with readability and understanding</li>
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> Users       approach online content and print content with different expectations and       behaviours</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Content  that ends up online often starts with an author opening up a print-based  program, like <abbr title="Microsoft">MS</abbr> Word. As a result, the author may unknowingly create a product  that is best suited for print, not the web. This is a key problem as the two  environments are very different. </p>
    <p>In a book there is an obvious start and stop point. The information  is presented as text on paper, with the possibility of supporting images. In a movie that is based on that same book, the paper becomes a luminous  environment without text. It &nbsp;relies instead  on moving imagery, colour, and dialogue. Although the core story is the same, the mediums are very different, as  a screenplay adapts the content from paper to  film.</p>
    <p>Similarly,  a product that is created for print must be adapted to work well on the web. <strong>If  the goal is to have the primary version of your content exist as a web page,  ensure you write your content for the web, not for print. Rework headings, change the layout, and rewrite text.</strong>  This ensures information is  easy for the user to discover.</p>
    <p>As we continue to rely heavily on responsive web design, which automatically adapts content to different browsers and devices for an optimal viewing experience, <strong>authors have to create intelligent content. Intelligent content is structured and categorized for automated reuse and adaptation across different platforms. This concept is also known as "content like water"</strong>. Content is designed in a way that is flexible, so it can flow anywhere.</p>
    <p>It is also  essential to understand users&rsquo; constraints in a changing web environment, such  as: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Reading text on a mobile device is like reading through a peephole</li>
      <li>Viewing with less screen space means less visible context and less  understanding</li>
      <li>Prioritizing and presenting most important information up front is required &minus; especially when lots of information resources exist</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Government requires that all web content is accessible. An  accessible web allows all users to access it, regardless of their browser,  device, resolution, settings or ability. <strong>Improve the accessibility of  the web to improve the usability for all users</strong>; this is the main principle of  universal design. </p>
    <p>To create  responsive and accessible web-ready content, there is a need to develop a new approach  to <a href="rchtctr-en.html">content  architecture</a>, <a href="stl-en.html">content style and flow</a>, as well as <a href="strctr-en.html">content structure and  presentation</a> for the web. </p>

      <p>Since the visitor of the page is the only person who clicks the mouse and therefore decides everything, user-centric design has become a standard.</p>
      <p>Basically, users' habits on the Web aren't that different from customers' habits in a store. Visitors glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they're looking for. In fact, there are large parts of the page they don't even look at.</p>

    <p>Much like how shoppers quickly scan a store's shelves and racks for a specific item, users scan webpages for specific information. The item a shopper wants may in fact be in the store, but if they can't easily find it, they leave. The same applies to users and webpages. Users leave the webpage or website altogether if it is an effort to find the information they seek.</p>

      <p>In linear media &mdash; such as print and <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr> &mdash; people expect you to construct their experience for them. Readers are willing to follow the author's lead.</p>
      <p>In non-linear hypertext, the rules reverse. Users want to construct their own experience by piecing together content from multiple sources, emphasizing their desires in the current moment. People arrive at a website with a goal in mind, and they are ruthless in pursuing their own interest and in rejecting whatever the site is trying to push.</p>

      <p>Universal Design takes into account the full range of human diversity,  including physical, perceptual and cognitive abilities, as well as different  body sizes and shapes. By designing for this diversity, we can create things  that are more functional and more user-friendly for everyone. For instance,  curb cuts at sidewalks were initially designed for people who use wheelchairs,  but they are now also used by pedestrians with strollers or rolling luggage.

    <p><strong>It is impossible to design great user experience for bad content.</strong> If users cannot understand what they are  reading, or if it is confusing or unnecessarily long, they cannot have a good  user experience. Duplicate and competing sources of information across a site  confuse and frustrate users. It often makes them give up on a task. <strong>If your content does not meet users&rsquo; needs,  you cannot meet your business objectives</strong>.</p>
    <p>In order to consistently generate good content that  meets users&rsquo; needs it is important to have a strategy. A content strategy involves planning,  prioritizing, developing, and managing content.</p>
    <p>Having a strategy helps  you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Plan</strong> what content to publish, when and where, as  well as identify who is accountable for it</li>
      <li> <strong>Prioritize </strong>content based on user and business needs,  while respecting the context of the whole web content system (entire intranet  or external website). Prioritizing content means focusing on the content that you are the authoritative owner of. It means limiting the amount of information to key messages which support a <strong>limited number of priorities</strong></li>
      <li> <strong>Establish a workflow</strong> for content development, approval,  evaluation, and review</li>
      <li> <strong>Set benchmarks</strong> and criteria to measure success of your  business goals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Effective content  strategy ensures your content is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> authoritative</li>
      <li>free of <abbr title="Redundant Outdated Trivial">ROT</abbr> and up to date</li>
      <li> found easily through search and browsing</li>
      <li>like water, able to adapt to different purposes and contexts, and is easily shared and reused</li>
      <li>well coordinated and comprehensive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To create useful and usable content that  enables you to meet your business needs, <strong>each area needs to develop  a specific content strategy prior to creating content</strong>. Ensure that  it aligns with the overarching content strategy for the whole organization, and continuously evolves.</p>
    <p>Executing your content strategy means you have to commit to managing your  content through its <strong>life cycle</strong>. Content can become less useful over time. Low content use, among other indicators, should trigger a content review.</p>
    <p>To ensure that content remains relevant and current, content owners need  to <strong>regularly review</strong> all of their pages and hyperlinks. Additional reviews may  be necessary to respond to specific user feedback or legislation changes. Work  together with an analytics team to determine how often users access your  content and whether it is still valuable.</p>
    <p>Identify redundant, outdated, or trivial content, and  submit a request to remove it. When you remove content from an online  environment,<strong> you are still responsible for keeping business records offline for  the required retention period</strong>. </p>

    <p>You are ready to develop  your content after you do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Review what content is out there and who owns it</li>
      <li>Identify your users&rsquo; needs and  business objectives</li>
      <li>Develop a content strategy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Without  good content, strategy, design, search, metadata (proper title, description, and keywords) or any other technical  improvement cannot help users find the right information. Proper websites  require a content strategy and governance. <strong>Content  requires consolidation and responsible management across the entire content  ecosystem.</strong> This is the only solution to information overload. </p>
    <p>Individual project  deliverables greatly impact the content ecosystem. While your business initiative  might be great on its own, when you place it in the context of other  initiatives and other information, these initiatives can cancel each other out.  They can also compete for users&rsquo; limited  attention. <strong>Ensure your initiative is part of the solution, not  part of the problem:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider broad  impacts of what you plan to publish</li>
      <li> Coordinate new initiatives with other  areas that have similar content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Innovation does not mean creating more of  something new. You can contribute to healthy innovation by reusing and  recycling what is already there:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reuse content by <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/writing/strctr-en.html#links">linking to content correctly</a>. For other options,  speak to your web team, as there may be ways to dynamically add content from another page, ensuring that a single and consistent source of information can be attached to multiple pages
      <ul>
          <li>Remember that  dynamic content can change without notice. Make this part of the  strategy to ensure correctness or completeness</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Recycle content by working with the area that created the  original content to adapt it to meet multiple needs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to reuse and  recycle content from outside your organization, <strong>be mindful of copyright</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>If there is no  content that you can reuse or recycle, create&nbsp;less content, reduce your  existing content, and limit users&rsquo; options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Consolidate all the  information users need to know about a topic or task in as few places as  possible</li>
      <li><a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/writing/rchtctr-en.html#faq">Do not create disconnected <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr>'s</a></li>
      <li> Limit related content to as few links as possible, both in-text and in other areas of the page. Only add related links if there is proof this information is actually relevant to the users at that point in time</li>
      <li>Remove  old pages when new, more effective content replaces it. This ensures  users find only the most current and useful information</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Less content is not  only more user-friendly, but it is also more strategic.</strong> A single instance of  information leads to consistent, streamlined process, accountability, ability  to measure success, and improves organizational agility.</p>

      <p>In [&hellip;] 9 studies on  information search-related time wasting, we found an average of 1.1 hours per  day per employee being lost in unproductive locating of information, with some  of the most authoritative sources even indicating up to 2 hours. This is a  tremendous waste of time and productivity &ndash; 1.1 hours a day is more than 12% of  total work time, summing up to more than 30 work days or 1.5 work months a year  per person. </p>
