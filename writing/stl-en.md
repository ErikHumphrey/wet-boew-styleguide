    <p>Depending on the context of your content, you may have to be more  critical of what words to keep. For example, in applications which often  have very limited space and many actions, do not use the words: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"My", "you" and "your" unless there is a very good reason to  do so (using these words may  lead the user to believe that what you are  referring to is customizable; if this is not the case, you are misusing  generally accepted web conventions and confusing users)</li>
      <li>"Please" except when communicating an  error message</li>
      <li>"Provide", "enter", and "type" </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Start with the verb when you describe  actions.</strong> Eliminate any descriptive information that precedes the verb.</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> Submit your completed documents</li>

	<p>Focus on the most  important information. Make it action oriented.

		<p class="mrgn-tp-lg">If we review the before and after costs  to translate 36 words, the difference is not that noticeable:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Before word  reduction</strong>, the paragraph contains 36 words and would cost $9 to translate into 1 language at $.25/word</li>
		  <li><strong>After word reduction</strong>, there are only 17 words  which would cost $4.25 to translate  into 1 language at $.25/word</li>

    <p>Writing  in plain language means using simple, basic language of your audience.</p>
    <p>To write in  plain language, use familiar terms and phrases, include only one idea in each  sentence. Keep paragraphs short and focused. </p>
    <p><strong>Do not use the internal  language of your organization</strong>. <strong>Avoid jargon and overly technical terms</strong>. If you must use terms that  are not familiar to your user, define them using common terms. </p>
    <p>If  you must use <strong>acronyms or abbreviations,  spell them out in full the first time you use them</strong> on a page. Then place  the abbreviation or acronym in brackets next to the full spelling for example,  Canada Revenue Agency (<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>).</p>
    <p>Use  these guidelines to write in plain language:&nbsp; </p>

    <div id="passive-info">
      <p>Passive voice creates confusion for readers; <strong>it is not clear who is responsible for the action</strong>.  Passive  voice results from the use of the verb "to be". To write in an active, positive voice, avoid the following 8 words:</p>

    <p>Users  do not read online in the same way that they read a printed book. Instead they scan  the web page. <strong>Break up the content</strong> with lists, sub-headings and shorter paragraphs to increase their ability to  assess information quickly.</p>
    <p>Adjust for this user behaviour and ensure maximum uptake of information: write for online audiences in a more direct manner. <strong>Offer</strong> the same <strong>information in  about half the space compared to</strong> that geared for <strong>print</strong>.</p>
    <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-xl">
      <p>People  rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, <strong>they scan the page</strong>, picking  out individual words and sentences.

      <p>On  the average Web page, users have time to read at most 28% of the words during  an average visit; 20% is more likely.</p>
      <p>We've  known since our first studies of how users read on the Web that they typically  don't read very much. <strong>Scanning </strong>text is an extremely common behavior for  higher-literacy users; our recent eyetracking studies further validate this  finding.</p>

    <p>Headings,  bulleted lists, hyperlinks, and sentences are read or scanned much easier if you  write them in a parallel structure. A parallel structure means you keep the  same grammatical pattern for each element. Use the same verb  tense, same sentence structure, same voice, and same terms. Parallel structure means there is a logical theme that connects every item in the group. In addition, every item is distinct, does not overlap and is presented in a logical order, if order is important.

    <p><strong>Users  hunt for information</strong>. They arrive on a web page and scan the content in search of information. If they cannot find what  they are searching for, they continue their hunt by following a link to another  page. How do they choose the next link? They virtually sniff out the link that has  the strongest scent. This practice is known as following the scent of  information.</p>
    <p>With  this user behaviour in mind, <strong>it is crucial to use descriptive links which closely resemble the title or heading of the destination page</strong>. Vague, poorly named, obscure, or  incomplete links decreases the scent and frustrates users. Sometimes it leads them  to abandon their hunt. In addition to descriptive links, users pick up the  scent of information from graphics and the layout.

    <p><strong>Consistency and  predictability make sites easy to use, as the user does not have to learn new conventions  each time</strong>. These reduce user&rsquo;s cognitive load, frustration, and time spent on  trying to determine if or how two similar things are distinct.</p>
    <p>To create good user  experience, ensure &nbsp;<strong>you present similar  content consistently from interface to interface and from page to page</strong>. Use  repeatable patterns that users can easily recognize.</p>
    <p>Consistency  applies to the following web elements: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>language</strong> &ndash; terminology, labeling</li>
      <li><strong>visual elements</strong> &ndash; images, fonts, backgrounds, colours</li>
      <li><strong>user interface elements</strong>, their layout and functionality &ndash; buttons,  tabs, sidebars, tables</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To ensure  consistency, <strong>be aware of the general web conventions users expect in any online  environment</strong>. This can include the functionality of the "Back" button or the  house icon which represents return to the homepage. Changing widely recognized  conventions can confuse and frustrate users. </p>
    <p>Also,  consider the impact of your visuals on the <strong>consistency of the entire website</strong>.  Use caution with the use of terminology; don&rsquo;t use different terms for the same  thing. For example, if there are two links on a page which say "workforce plan"  and "strategy for the workforce" would you know that these two links take you  to the same document? What about "staffing glossary", "staffing lexicon", and  "staffing terms"? Can you tell if these links will take you to the same or  different information?</p>
    <p>Do not  underestimate the value of consistency for the organization.It helps your  content appear more <strong>reliable and professional</strong>. </p>
    <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-xl">
      <p>Users should feel  [at home] when they visit your site. They shouldn&rsquo;t have to spend a long time  finding what they&rsquo;re looking for. A consistent website is predictable and  therefore learnable. After a while, users will find the information that  they&rsquo;re searching for effortlessly. [&hellip;] Don&rsquo;t take this as a ban on experimentation. Experimentation is  essential to design. Keep in mind, though, that experimentation may introduce  unpredictability, which can have a drastic impact on your website&rsquo;s usability. </p>

    <p>Many  users turn to a website's search tool to find information. Search tools try to  match the users' search terms to a web page by comparing the search terms to  page titles, headings, text, and metadata. The search tool then displays the web  pages that most closely match the search terms.</p>
    <p>You need to understand the following to take  advantage of the search capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> A search engine is only as good as the content in it,  its metadata, and the indexing strategy</li>
      <li> <strong>Too much useful  content clogs up the search engine, and makes it difficult to find the right information</strong>; an indexing strategy specifically tailored to the information context, rather than any individual&rsquo;s opinion or preference, should define what content will be indexed (appear in search results) and what content will not be indexed (be further discovered through navigation from the main indexed pages)</li>
      <li> Users generally  only look at the first few links on the search results page. When  there are too many search results, users will likely  miss your content</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The best search optimization method is to <a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/writing/dvlpmnt-en.html#reuse">reuse,  recycle, and reduce content</a>, not create more content. </strong></p>
    <p>The key to providing users with the search results they are looking for is to <strong>use the search terms and phrases they likely use </strong> in the title, heading, text, and metadata: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify common search terms and phrases as you develop the content</li>
      <li>Use terms and phrases that users are likely to use when they search for your content. It is good practice  to identify those common search terms and phrases as you develop the content</li>
      <li>Use them often and consistently</li>
      <li>Avoid using expressions, jargon, metaphors, puns or any terms  that cannot be taken literally</li>
    </ul>
    <p> To ensure there is no confusion when users review  their search results, <strong>use a unique page  title.</strong> Include a concise summary of the content of the page in the page  description section of the metadata.
    <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-xl">
      <p>Many forces pressure Web writers to diminish a website's value by   filling it with words that are unlikely to appear in search queries.   Here are some guidelines for writing to ensure that users will find your   site: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supplement made-up words with known words</li>
        <li>Play down marketese and internal vocabulary</li>
        <li>Supplement brand names with generic terms</li>
        <li>Avoid "politically correct" terminology</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Familiar words spring to mind when users create their search queries. If   your writing favors made-up terms over legacy words, users won't find   your site.</p>

      <p>'You've just moved into a new place with a living room that you love because of its expansive walls. Now, you just need someplace to put those 200 prized books that you've had in boxes forever. How would you do that?' </p>
      <p>As we suspected, our participants' behaviors changed. A couple folks typed bookcase into the search box. Others typed shelves, book shelves, book shelf, and one shelves for books. And others didn't type anything into the search box, but clicked on the navigation links on the page, including storage systems. Most (but not all) found success using their own strategies.</p>

    <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-xl">
      <p>According to a 2002 study: <em>How Do People Evaluate a website's Credibility?,</em> the 'appeal of the overall visual design of a site, including layout,   typography, font size, and colour schemes,' is the number one factor we   use to evaluate a website's credibility.</p>
      <p>The more we learn about people, and how our brains process   information, the more we learn the truth of that phrase: form and   function aren't separate items.
